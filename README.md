# icc_database
The Project aims on creating a database for an ICC tournament using SQL.

# Entities in database
The database consists of 10 entites namely:
1) icc_admin
2) country_team
3) tournament
4) player
5) award
6) match
7) teamA
8) teamB
9) match_stats
10) player_stats

Using these 10 enities we will design a detailed ER model of attributes followed by SQL script.

#
The [tables.txt](https://github.com/Ryuga002/icc_database/blob/main/icc_sample_data.txt) file contains the SQL script to create Tables.<br>
The [sample.txt](https://github.com/Ryuga002/icc_database/blob/main/tables.txt)  file contains the sample data for the Entites that are created.
# script file
[project_sqlscripts.sql](https://github.com/Ryuga002/icc_database/blob/main/project_sqlscript.sql) file contains the detailed script file to run in a SQL server to create the entire ICC database.<br>
It is optional to add the sample data to the database.
# 
After running the script we can overview the entire database, the entire database consists of 10 entities with the following tables:<br>
[output_overview](https://github.com/Ryuga002/icc_database/tree/f15976e16eabb968be12b273bd104c38a9293dd4/output_overview) <br>
These 10 csv files will provide a intutive idea of our designed database.
